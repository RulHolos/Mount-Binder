Mount Binder is a simple FFXIV plugin allowing for binding mounts to key combinations.

Please create an [issue](https://github.com/AtaeKurri/Bartender/issues/new) if you find any bugs or want to see a new feature.

## Features

* Set a combinaison of keybinds to a mount.

## Usage

1. Create a new bind
2. Set your mount (only owned ones)
3. Set your keybinds
4. ???
5. Profit

However be careful, as the plugin *will still* send the pressed keys to the game. So there might be conflicts with your own native keybinds.

In the future, there might be an option to disable sending the keys to the game.
